<li>Some CollegeConnect posts discuss words or language that are considered profane, vulgar, or offensive by some readers.</li>
<li>Articles may contain only written representations of people or events which may be protected by some cultures.
CollegeConnectâ€™s current policy is to include such content, provided it breaches neither any of our existing policies (especially Neutral point of view) nor the laws of the India, where CollegeConnect is hosted. See a list of controversial issues for some examples of articles that may contain such content. Some of these articles contain warnings, but many do not.</li>
<li>In any case, CollegeConnect is a work in progress, and articles may contain errors. We encourage readers to help us fix these problems. CollegeConnect's coverage is based on the interests of its volunteer contributors. Readers should not judge the importance of topics based on their coverage in CollegeConnect, nor assume that a topic is important merely because it is the subject of a CollegeConnect article.</li>
